            I'm have made this website to display my projects.
            Just hover over of a project to see the basics of application.
            My details are at the top of the page. 
            I can write in Java, C#, C, HTML, CSS and Haskell. 
            I learn best when I can use the information to build something useful as the information has a practical application.
            That is the main reason I build these projects, some of the projects are proof of concept or even just to 
            make some computer thoery abit more concrete.

The 3D modeling work was very challenging, making workers look as if they are collecting resources combined with pathfinding created a lot of complexity.

The casing for this project was made out of scrapes that I found around the house, the log (where the LEDs are housed) was from a tree that feel near my house. The circuity is fairly simple, it’s just an Arduino wired to a clock module.

Take some large plastic bottles form airtight seals between them and pump air into them to cause high pressure within the 2-liter bottles. Then use a trigger of some sort to form to release this air and carry BB pellets. Fortunately, this was a very cheap project to make, the most expensive part was the tire valves.

                     I was just getting to grips with the core concepts of HTML and CSS. Hopefully you will see how the site has improved over time, as I have become more familar with web design.
